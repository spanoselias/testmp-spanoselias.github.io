<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap"></span>Welcome to my personal blog!! </p>

It is been a long time since I was thinking to create my personal blog, and finally I managed to do so. 
Even though it is not difficult task to design and implement a simple blog, you will probably spend adequate time until to implement it.  Anyway, I do not like talking generally, so let focus on the reason of creating this blog. 
Well, the reason of creating this blog it is just to share some things which I have or going to learn related to programming, data management and distributed system. More precisely, I like exploring data systems from relational databases to big data systems (such as Hadoop and Spark).
